To work on this lab from your own machine, you'll need to meet the following requirements.

Client Pre-Reqs
Python 2.7
virtual environment (suggested but not required)
pip
"git" command line tools
Google Chrome + Postman
ACI Toolkit
Cobra SDK
Workstation Setup Instructions
This lab can be completed from a Windows, Mac, or Linux workstation as long as the above pre-reqs are installed. If you are using a Linux distribution, then it is likely you already have Python 2.7 installed. To assist with completion, here are some suggested steps to prepare common platforms.

If your environment requires a proxy server to access internet resources, be sure that it is configured correctly on your system, and adjust any steps/commands listed below as needed.

Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7
Install Postman
This lab uses Postman to make API calls; if you do not have it installed, it can be downloaded from:

https://www.getpostman.com/apps
Pull Down Sample Code and Prep Python Environment
With the software pre-reqs installed on your workstation, next you will get the sample code from GitHub, setup the Python environment, and install any Python requirements with pip.

MAC or Linux
#From your working directory
git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/aci-learning-labs-code-samples
cd aci-learning-labs-code-samples
virtualenv venv --python=python2.7
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Windows
#From your working directory
git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/aci-learning-labs-code-samples
cd aci-learning-labs-code-samples
virtualenv venv --python=C:\Python27\python.exe
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt

Install ACI Toolkit
With your Virtual Environment activated, you can now download and install the ACI Toolkit using git.

Full details on ACI Toolkit available in documentation

MAC or Linux or Windows
# From your working directory
git clone https://github.com/datacenter/acitoolkit.git
cd acitoolkit
python setup.py install
Install Cobra SDK
Step 1: Download SDK Files
Full details on Cobra SDK available in documentation

The Cobra SDK files are typically downloaded from a physical APIC appliance. If you have a physical APIC running code 3.0 or higher, you can browse to your APIC address and download both Python 2.7 egg files:

http[s]://[APIC address]/cobra/_downloads/

NOTE: If you don't have an access to APIC you may download the egg files from DevNet by clicking on below links.

You will need to be logged into DevNet in order to download the files. If you are prompted to login after clicking a link and the download doens't start, just click the link a second time after logging in.

acicobra-3.0_1k-py2.7.egg
acimodel-3.0_1k-py2.7.egg
Step 2: Install SDK
With your Virtual Environment activated, you can now install the Python Cobra SDK Modules.

MAC or Linux or Windows
# From your Downloads Dirctory
easy_install -Z acicobra-[apic_version]-py2.7.egg
easy_install -Z acimodel-[apic_version]-py2.7.egg

# Note: If you are NOT using a Virtual Environment, you may need to use "sudo" to install
